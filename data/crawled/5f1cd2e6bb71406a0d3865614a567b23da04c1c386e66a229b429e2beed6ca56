Donaldson and James Hennegan.[1][2] Originally titled Billboard Advertising it was a trade paper for the bill posting industry, hence the magazine's name.[1] Within a few years of its founding, it began to carry news of outdoor amusements, a major consumer of billboard space. Eventually, Billboard became the paper of record for circuses, carnivals, amusement parks, fairs, vaudeville, minstrels, whale shows[3] and other live entertainment. The magazine began coverage of motion pictures in 1909 and of radio in the 1920s. The first music connections were the Billboard sheet music best sellers and top songs in vaudeville theaters charts, published in 1913, but they were not yet regular charts.[4]"]}}}
