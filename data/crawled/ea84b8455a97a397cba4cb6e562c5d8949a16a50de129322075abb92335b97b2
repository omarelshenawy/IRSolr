The Illustrated London News observed that the opera had not been updated with new dialogue, jokes and songs, but concluded that this was for the best, as the public would have missed the \"time-honoured jokes, such as 'Hardly Ever.' The Savoy has once more got a brilliant success.\"[121] The Theatre concurred, stating that since the opera \"has been heard in almost every part of this habitable globe and been enjoyed everywhere, there is not much occasion to descant\". It called the revival a \"most brilliant\" success and predicted another long run.[122]"],"after":["Reviewing the 1899 revival, The Athenaeum managed to praise the piece while joining in the musical establishment's critique of Sullivan. On the one hand, \"The Pinafore ... sounds fresher than ever. The musical world has become serious – very serious – and it is indeed refreshing to hear a merry, humorous piece, and music, unassuming in character … it is delicately scored, and in many ways displays ability of a high order\". On the other hand, it wrote that if Sullivan had pursued the path of composing more serious music, like his symphony, \"he would have produced still higher results; in like manner Pinafore set us wondering what the composer would have accomplished with a libretto of somewhat similar kind, but one giving him larger scope for the exercise of his gifts\".[123]"]}}}
