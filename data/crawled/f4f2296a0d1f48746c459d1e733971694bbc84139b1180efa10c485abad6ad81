U.S. Highways are also numbered in a grid: even numbered for east–west routes (with the lowest numbers along Canada) and odd numbered for north–south routes (with the lowest numbers along the Atlantic Ocean). Three-digit highways, also known as \"child routes,\" are branches off their main one- or two-digit \"parents\" (for example, U.S. Route 202 is a branch of U.S. Route 2). However, US 101, rather than a \"child\" of US 1, is considered a \"mainline\" U.S. Route."],"after":["State highways are the next level in the hierarchy. Each state and territory has its own system for numbering highways, some more systematic than others. Each state also has its own design for its highway markers; the number in a circle is the default sign, but many choose a different design connected to the state, such as an outline of the state with the number inside. Many states also operate a system of county highways."]}}}
