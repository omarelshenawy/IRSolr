The first super-dreadnoughts are generally considered to be the British Orion class. What made them 'super' was the unprecedented 2,000-ton jump in displacement, the introduction of the heavier 13.5-inch (343 mm) gun, and the placement of all the main armament on the centreline. In the four years between Dreadnought and Orion, displacement had increased by 25%, and weight of broadside had doubled.[121]"]}}}
