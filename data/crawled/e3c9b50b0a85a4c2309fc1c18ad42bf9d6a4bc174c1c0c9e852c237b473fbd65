It is spoken in the Swedish province of Jämtland. It is commonly used in the region between the modern Swedish–Norwegian border in the west and the pre-1645 Swedish-Norwegian border in the east, though Trøndersk is spoken in Frostviken in the northernmost part of Jämtland colonized in the 18th century by Norwegians, and Norrlandic is spoken in Ragunda in the easternmost part of Jämtland which until the 13th century was a part of Ångermanland."]}}}
