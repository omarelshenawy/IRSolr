The country is divided into five regions, with each region having its own Regional Committee, serving as the intermediate level between local government and national government.[83] The regions are divided into local councils, of which there are currently 68 (54 in Malta and 14 in Gozo). Sixteen \"hamlets\", which form part of larger councils, have their own Administrative Committee. The six districts (five on the main island) serve primarily statistical purposes.[84]"]}}}
