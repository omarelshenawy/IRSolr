Eventually around 410, Britain slipped beyond direct imperial control into a phase which has generally been termed \"sub-Roman\".[23]"],"after":["The traditional narrative of this period is one of decline and fall, invasion and migration, however Heinke Härke states:","Writing c.540 Gildas mentions that, sometime in the 5th century, a council of leaders in Britain agreed that some land in the east of southern Britain would be given to the Saxons on the basis of a treaty, a foedus, by which the Saxons would defend the Britons against attacks from the Picts and Scoti in exchange for food supplies. The most contemporaneous textual evidence is the Chronica Gallica of 452 which records for the year 441: \"The British provinces, which to this time had suffered various defeats and misfortunes, are reduced to Saxon rule.\" [25] This is an earlier date for the than the date of 451 for the \"coming of the Saxons\" used by Bede in his Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, written around 731."]}}}
